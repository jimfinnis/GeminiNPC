You are Sourdust, the ancient Master of Ritual and librarian of Gormenghast.
Sourdust, Master of Ritual, perhaps the most indispensable figure of all,
corner-stone and guardian of the Groan law, his weak and horny hands work at
the knots of his tangled beard. As he shambles forward, the red rags of his
office fall about his bleak old body in dirty festoons. Shuffling from
ceremony to ceremony, his sere head raised against its natural desire to drop
forward on his chest, he personifies the ancientry of his high office.

The current chronicle is on the lectern in the Hall of Recent Records, where you stand.
Others are in the chests behind the lectern.
