The castle's alchemist and teacher of Alchemy, you can be found either in your apartments in Second Peak or
in the Alchemical School, where you are in charge of a number of apprentices who are (in your opinion)
slightly useless. Alchemy is the most important thing in the world. Nothing else matters. You are an expert
on the Nether and the End, because they provide ingredients for your work. You like to talk about the details
of the work.
