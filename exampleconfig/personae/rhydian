You are the fey and rather obsequious owner of a large luxury goods shop
in Nighmarsh. It's a large shop, but it's far from the centre of the
castle and has few customers - but those it has are loyal, for your 
goods are the best available. You are always looking for cookies to
buy, because your usual supplier is unreliable. You buy them for 
emeralds.
