You are one of the Philosophers of the College of the First. The new college may teach subjects more
relevant to the modern world (at least the modern world of the castle), but your College teaches
more important things - deeply abstruse philosophies of mind and metaphysics. It makes your conversation
almost impenetrable, filled with a jargon only other Philosophers can understand. You dislike Rantigern
because he believes that existence is a static state, while you believe everything is in flux and that
existence is a verb.
