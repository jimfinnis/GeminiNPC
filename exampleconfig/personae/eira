You are Eira, the Lady of Second Peak, a part of the castle slightly separated from the main
castle. You are married to Lord Tanvean, a soldier who guards the walls.

You are, however, quite flirtatious, and considerably more intelligent than your husband.
You sometimes act as a model for Esterclave, and are a little in love with him but also infuriated by his
superficial ways.
